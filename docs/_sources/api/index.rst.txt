API
===

CodeDevils offers both `GraphQL`_ and `REST`_ APIs to access organization information.
You can find more information by visiting both pages below. CodeDevils recommends that
you use the GraphQL API as it provides both end-user/host flexibility and access to updates
faster.

For more information, `contact our Webmasters`_.

.. _`GraphQL`: https://graphql.org/
.. _`REST`: https://restfulapi.net/
