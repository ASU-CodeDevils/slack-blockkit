Slack Blockkit Builder is a simple utility for developing code blocks for `Slack's Block Kit`_. It provides
Pythonic-style blocks to allow for dynamic generation of block kits where copy-and-paste just won't do it.


Installation
------------

Installation is as easy as:

.. code:: bash

    pip install slack_blockkit

It is currently tested on Python3+, but can be used for Python 2.7.

Usage
-----

Categories
**********

`Slack's Block Kit`_ comes with 4 different block categories:

1. `Block elements`_ - The standard element of a block.
2. `Composition objects`_ - Composition objects can be used inside of block elements and certain message payload fields. They are simply common JSON object patterns that you'll encounter frequently when building blocks or composing messages.
3. `Interactive components`_ - Interactive components are a subset of Block Kit elements that add interactivity to various app surfaces.
4. `View payloads`_ - Views are app-customized visual areas within modals and Home tabs.

.. warning::

    Some interactive components are not implemented in version 0.0.3

Example Usage
*************

You can access the different components by importing them from their respective package. For example, `Block elements`_
can be accessed by importing ``from slack_blockkit.block_element import ...``. A common block element is the ``TextObject``:

.. code-block:: python

    from slack_blockkit.block_element import TextObject

    text_object = TextObject(btype="mrkdwn", text="This is a text block")

Blocks are inserted into a list as dicts. Each component comes with a `render()` method which will return a ``dict``:

.. code-block:: python

    text_object.render()  # {"type": "mrkdwn", "block_id": "<uuid>", "text": "This is a text block"}

.. note::

    **btype** in synonymous with Slack's **type**. **type** is reserved in Python.

Message Blocks
**************

Message payloads to Slack take a ``list`` of dictionaries. The ``slack_blockkit.utils`` module has a ``get_blocks``
method that takes Block objects and returns the formatted list:

.. code-block:: python

    from slack_blockkit.utils import get_blocks
    from slack_blockkit.text_object import TextObject
    from slack_blockkit.layout_block import DividerBlock, ImageBlock

    blocks = get_blocks(
        TextObject(btype="mrkdwn", text="Welcome to CodeDevils!"),
        DividerBlock(),
        ImageBlock(image_url="https://codedevils.org/static/img/logo", alt_text="Logo")
    )

Which makes ``blocks``:

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "block_id": "<uuid>",
        "text": "Welcome to CodeDevils!"
    },
    {
        "type": "divider"
        "block_id": "<uuid>"
    },
    {
        "type": "image",
        "block_id": "<uuid>",
        "image_url": "https://codedevils.org/static/img/logo",
        "alt_text": "Logo"
    }

Utils
*****

Common composite blocks are implemented for you in ``slack_blockkit.utils`` and include:

* ``get_task_block`` - Returns a task block, which is comprised of a paragraph of text followed by an information link at the bottom.
* ``get_text_block_with_image`` - Returns a text block with an image to the right of it.
* ``get_text_block_with_accessory`` - Returns a text block with an accessory.
* ``get_information_block`` - Returns an information block, which is a section with an info icon followed by linked text.
* ``get_checkmark`` - *Not* a block, but rather an emoji string for a checkmark. Pass ``True`` for a checked mark and ``False`` for unchecked.
